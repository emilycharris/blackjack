_This assignment was completed as part of my coursework at The Iron Yard._

##Implement the game of Blackjack.

**Objectives**

After completing this assignment, you should understand:
- how to track state by using objects
- how to design classes to collaborate and communicate
- build an interactive game
- fundamentals of Object Oriented Programing

**Normal Mode**

Take your CRC cards and notes and code examples from Part 1 create a game of Blackjack that one person plays on the command line against a computer dealer, with the following rules:

- The only valid moves are hit and stand.
- Allow the player to play as many turns as they want.
- The dealer uses one deck and reshuffles after each round.
- [OPTIONAL] The game should start the player with $100 and bets are $10. A player's turn is over when they are out of money

**Notes**

This is again an assignment with a text-based interface, which can be very hard to test. You will do best at this assignment by building all the logic for each piece and testing it well before then adding the interface on top of it.

I used Python in order to complete this assignment.
